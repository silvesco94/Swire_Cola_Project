Predictive maintenance for Swire Coca-Cola


## Business Problem  

### [Business Problem Statement](Business%20Problem%20Statement.docx)

Swire Coca-Cola's production plants operate six facilities that produce approximately 192 million cases of beverages annually. However, the plants experience a production shortfall, producing only 94.4% of the total intended cases due to unplanned mechanical breakdowns and maintenance issues. This gap, costing the company approximately $60 million in lost productivity annually, results from unanticipated downtimes caused by machinery failures across various production lines. The current process relies on reactive maintenance through an Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC) system, which issues work orders only after machinery failures occur, leading to significant delays in repairs and downtime.

### Deliverables
- A validated predictive model.
- Insights into machine failure patterns.
- A final report detailing findings and recommendations.


## Groups Solution to the Business Problem 

Our group developed a multi-faceted predictive maintenance solution for Swire Coca-Cola, leveraging key analytics techniques:

1. **Survival Analysis (Main Focus)**:
   - Estimated the likelihood of machinery failures over time.
   - Provided actionable insights into expected failure timelines, enabling better maintenance scheduling.

2. **Random Forest Model**:
   - Identified key features influencing machine breakdowns, such as component wear and machine age.

3. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Predicted the probability of equipment failures under specific conditions.

These approaches collectively enabled Swire Coca-Cola to anticipate failures, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance schedules for increased production efficiency.
